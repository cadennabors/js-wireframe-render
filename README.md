# js-wireframe-render
Fast JS wireframe renderer.
[Online Demo](https://cadennabors.github.io/js-wireframe-render/)

This is an efficient JS software renderer developed for fun, and to learn about 3d computer graphics.

This project can import .obj files, and can also automatically load local models (with a bit of .js hacking)
